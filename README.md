Jammming
Jammming is a React app that allows users to interact with Spotify. (Requires having a Spotify account for playlists to be saved)

The purpose is to create a simple app that allows users to:

connect their Spotify account to the app;
search for songs, artists, albums;
add selected songs to a new playlist;
name the playlist;
save it to their own Spotify account.
The things that I learned and practiced during the creation of this app were:

how to create stateful and stateless components;
how to pass props from one component to another;
how to pass a state as a prop to a component;
how to use Fetch API to make GET and POST requests;
how to handle promises and data that they might return.
